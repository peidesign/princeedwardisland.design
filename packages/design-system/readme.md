## Quick start

P.E.I Design's design system can be used without any installation, anywhere HTML works, by using the source from unpkg by dropping the following into your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/@peidesign/design-system/dist/css/peid-design-system.min.css">
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@peidesign/design-system/dist/components/index.mjs"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/@peidesign/design-system/dist/components/index.js"></script>
```

## Customization

P.E.I Design's design system can be completely customized from within your application using CSS custom properties.

It allows for:

- **Design token customization**: the base building blocks of the entire system are comprised of CSS custom properties, which form the basis of all atomic CSS classes and component styles.
- **Component customization**: each component has it's own set of CSS custom properties, which handles the appearance for that component.

### Design tokens

Design token variables are customized by overriding them in the `:root` selector of your application's primary stylesheet:

```
:root {
  --peid-color-red-0: red;
}
```

All design tokens variables can be found at [`./src/global/tokens/`][./src/global/tokens/].

### Components

Components can be customized by targetting the component selector and overriding the default variables in your application's stylesheets. E.g, for the `peid-card` component:

```
peid-card {
    --background: red;
}
```

All component variables can be found with the components, which are found at [./src/components/].
